# spring-web-flux-example
The reactive-stack web framework, Spring WebFlux, has been added Spring 5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports reactive streams back pressure.
that promotes an asynchronous, non-blocking, event-driven approach to data processing. Reactive programming involves modeling data and events as observable data streams and implementing data processing routines to react to the changes in those streams.

# Non-blocking request processing
In non-blocking or asynchronous request processing, no thread is in waiting state. There is generally only one request thread receiving the request.

All incoming requests come with a event handler and call back information. Request thread delegates the incoming requests to a thread pool (generally small number of threads) which delegate the request to itâ€™s handler function and immediately start processing other incoming requests from request thread.

When the handler function is complete, one of thread from pool collect the response and pass it to the call back function.
